## Time Complexity
In this repository, we provide time complexity analysis for each algorithm based on different scenarios. The following scenarios are considered:

- **Worst Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes the maximum amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is in its most unfavorable state.

- **Best Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes the minimum amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is in its most favorable state.

- **Average Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes an average amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is randomly distributed.
