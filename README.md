## Time Complexity
In this repository, we provide time complexity analysis for each algorithm based on different scenarios. The following scenarios are considered:

- **Worst Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes the maximum amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is in its most unfavorable state.

- **Best Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes the minimum amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is in its most favorable state.

- **Average Case**: This represents the scenario where the algorithm takes an average amount of time to run, typically occurring when the input data is randomly distributed.


## Sorting

# **Bubble sort:** 
**repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order**
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the sort progresses. 
<br>While it is easy to understand and implement, bubble sort is not efficient for large data sets as its **time complexity is O(n^2)**.

# **selection sort:** 
**repeatedly selects the smallest or largest element and places it at the beginning or end of the list**

The **time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2)** as it involves nested loops to find the minimum element and swap it with the current element.

The space complexity of selection sort is O(1) as it only requires a single temporary variable for swapping elements and does not require any additional memory allocation.
