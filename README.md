In this repository, you will find Python implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. These implementations serve as examples and learning resources for those interested in understanding how these concepts work and how they can be implemented in Python.

## Data Structures

The repository currently includes implementations of the following data structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented as a separate Python module and includes the necessary operations and functionalities associated with that particular data structure.

## Algorithms

The repository also includes implementations of various algorithms, including:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)

Similar to the data structures, each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python module and includes the necessary functions and methods to perform the desired operations.
